# snake-in-java-21
this is a simple snake clone using JFrame an JPanel only, using class inheritance and 1 array list to represent the body of the snake
the arrows are the controls, for some reasonn, the keypress was having issues on windows 10, this code should work on windows 11, and UNIX
there is no specific reason to use java 21 on this project, when I created this project I toguth the getLast() method was already a default implementation of
ArrayLists.
